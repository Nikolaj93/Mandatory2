Mandatory: Banko Play C-programming

Description: 
I decided to go with the Banko Play C programming mandatory.
Unfortunately I didn't have any buttons/keypad to connect to the Arduino,
so this mandatory is pure C programming.
I have tried to include topics as modular programming(.c & .h files),
pointers, structures & memory management.
As an addition I made the banko numbers on the plates colorful to easier show a hit.
